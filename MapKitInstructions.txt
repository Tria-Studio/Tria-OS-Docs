--[[ BASIC MAP FUNCTIONALITY
	
	Every map needs a MapScript, ExitRegion, Spawn, Settings, and buttons as direct childs to the main map model to operate.
	Spawn has a side marked as the front, players will spawn facing this direction when they spawn.
	Buttons have to be numbered progressively. If 2 buttons are named _Button3, you won't be able to press one of them. Likewise, if 
	you have _Button2 and _Button4 but not _Button3, you will not be able to press the fourth button.

--[[ ON THE TOPIC OF LIQUID
	
	There are three default liquid types, those being "water", "acid", and "lava".
	
	You also have the ability to make custom water types by going in to Settings, then to Liquids, and duplicate or change the "custom" water state.
	
	The name of the configuration below Liquids is the name of the liquid type.
	The "Color" string is the colour of the liquid type, and it will change to that colour when the type is changed through a script.
	The "OxygenDepletion" string decides how much air drains per second. (Negative numbers mean you gain air instead of losing air)
	The "SplashSound" is the ID of the sound it makes when you enter and exit the liquid.
	
	You can assign a part to be liquid by turning cancollide off and assigning a liquid type to it, either using a script or a StringValue.
	To set it using a StringValue, add a StringValue to any liquid part, and rename it "Type". Then, set the Value to any liquid type.
	To set it using the script, use 'Lib.setLiquidType(Lib.Map._Water._Liquid#, "type")'.

--[[ ON THE TOPIC OF WALLJUMPING/WALLRUNNING
	
	To assign a part to be a walljump, insert an ObjectValue with the name of "_WallJump", leaving the Value blank.
	
	To assign a part to be a wallrun, insert an NumberValue with the name of "_WallRun", and insert how many studs per second you want the player
	to move towards local positive X direction in the value.

--[[ ON THE TOPIC OF BUTTONS
	
	Buttons are neccessary components for any map. A person can only exit once they've pressed all the buttons in the map.
	Group buttons are a type of buttons where 50% of people have to press it before it's pressed. To make a group button, 
	insert a StringValue called "Group" inside of a button model.
	
	You can use the default model for buttons or make your own. To make your own button, you can make it any design. However, it is required
	that it's in a model called "_Button#", the # being the button number, and there are 2 parts called "Hitbox" and "Light" inside of it,
	the hitbox being invisible and having cancollide off.
	
	In settings, you will be able to find a configuration called "Button". Here, you can customize button locators.
	"DisabledColor" = the color of the buttons & locators when you don't have to press them yet.
	"EnabledColor" = the color of normal buttons & locators when you have to press them.
	"EnabledGroupColor" = the color of group buttons & locators when you have to press them.
	"LocatorImage" = the image of button locators. 
	"PressedColor" = the color of buttons when they've been pressed.
	
	For locator image there are 4 built-in designs you can pick from. These being:
	"default"
	"classic"
	"circle"
	"square"

--[[ THE SETTINGS
	
	--LIGHTING SETTINGS--
	
	These are fairly straight forward, as these settings have the exact same names and do the same thing as they do in the "Lighting" property
	in the explorer, most lighting options are supported, those not supported are as follows: Technology, ClockTime. Trying to use these settings will not work.
	
	--MAIN SETTINGS--
	
	"Creator" - Insert the creator(s) of the map here.
	"Difficulty" - The difficulty of the map. ("1" = Easy, "2" = Normal, "3" = Hard, "4" = Insane,"5" = Extreme and "6" = Valiant.)
	"Image" - The thumbnail of the map.
	"MaxTime" - The time players can exist in a map before exceeding max time in seconds. (Maximum you can set is 7 minutes, aka 420 seconds.)
	"Music" - The ID of the music the map is going to use.
	"MusicVolume" - The volume of the map music. (e.g 1 = volume of the roblox audio, 0.5 = halved volume, 2 = double volume)
	"Name" - The map name.

	MapLib.ButtonPressed -- Is a RBXSignal that is fired when a button is pressed
	MapLib.Map -- Reference the map instance
	MapLib.btnFuncs [Deprecated] -- indexes of this table will be called when a button is pressed, please use MapLib:GetButtonEvent() instead of this.
	
	MapLib:GetButtonEvent(buttonID: number): Event(player) -- returns a event that will be fired when the specified buttonID is pressed.
	
	all of the below functions are non-asynced meaning that they will not yield
	
	MapLib:Alert(message: string, color: Color3, time: number) -- Will display a alert on all players screens
